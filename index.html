                        Who invented The Burger? üçî
                    </summary>
                    <p>The origins of the burger are shrouded in mystery, but most food historians agree that it was invented in the United States in the late 1800s or early 1900s. Here are a few contenders for the title of ‚Äúinventor of the burger‚Äù:

                       <ul>
                      <li>
                        Charlie Nagreen: This Wisconsin native claimed to have sold the first burger in Outagamie County in 1885. ‚ÄúHamburger Charlie‚Äù Nagreen reportedly flattened a meatball and placed it between two slices of bread to make it easier for fairgoers to eat.
                    </li>
                      <li>
                        Louis Lassen: According to legend, Lassen invented the burger in 1900 at his small restaurant in New Haven, Connecticut. He placed a beef patty between two slices of bread and added cheese and condiments, creating the first ‚Äúhamburger sandwich.‚Äù
                    </li>
                      <li>
                        Oscar Weber Bilby: Bilby was a cook in Oklahoma in 1891. He ran out of pork for his famous ‚Äúpork sausage sandwich‚Äù and substituted a beef patty, creating what he called a ‚Äúhamburg steak sandwich.‚Äù
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                        While we may never know for sure who invented the burger, it‚Äôs clear that it quickly became a popular food in the United States. By the 1920s, burgers were being sold at roadside stands and diners across the country, and by the 1950s they had become a symbol of American culture and fast food.
